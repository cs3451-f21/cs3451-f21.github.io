## Resources

I will be using a variety of technology to support various parts of running this class.

We will use Github Classroom to distribute and collect assignments. The github site is linked on the top of this page. Github classroom takes care of creating a private repository for each student when you check out an assignment, and the TAs and Instructor will be given access. Github is also used for this website.

Canvas will be used for announcements, posting grades, or for sharing other private content.  Most content will be shared here on github.

[Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3avTZRlThKBw-t2Se3RLXY0BYLWJi-qKmrUA460cQmlyY1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=9744a91e-039d-4938-9a34-3caab74609c7&tenantId=482198bb-ae7b-4b25-8b7a-6d7f32faa083) will be used for questions and discussion. The Teams site is not created automatically.  (We have added many students already, and will continue to do so, but if you do not have access, there should be a way to request access when you click the link to visit the Team.)

## Technology Resources

There are vast amounts of resources for Typescript on the web, starting with the documentation and examples on [https://typescriptlang.org](https://typescriptlang.org).  Also notice that Typescript is open source, and hosted at [https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript). The repository has links to various resources, but also discussions galore in the issues.

Similarly, there are plenty of WebGL resources out there. The [WebGL Fundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org/) and [WebGL2 Fundamentals](https://webgl2fundamentals.org/) websites are great resources for low level WebGL programming.  

Other useful references are:
- various books on O'Reilly Safari.  We've created a [playlist](https://learning.oreilly.com/playlists/46f06d9e-8e9e-45d1-9880-19f54c295c98) of some of the more interesting ones.  
- David Eck's online book [Introduction to Computer Graphics](http://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/) (Version 1.2, January 2018). It uses three.js.
- A good starting point for three.js is [https://threejs.org](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript), the main site for the library. It is also open source, and the source for all the examples and samples are in the distribution on github.  The examples are mostly pretty simple and self contained, although poorly documented.  There are more resources if you look, though. 
- The [ThreeJS Fundamentals](https://threejsfundamentals.org/) is a great resource for three.js.

If you like video, searching for Typescript or WebGL (or any other web related topic) on [https://channel9.msdn.com](https://channel9.msdn.com) yields a lot of different videos from over the years.
